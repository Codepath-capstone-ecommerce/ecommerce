#Project Proposal

Pod Members: Kordell Schrock, Diego Saldonid

##Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.
*local business hypothetical*
A local business approached us and wanted us to build them a website. So we can take their business from only in-person to everyone with internet access. Over the past year with covid their sales declined due to closing their in-person store temporarily and now wants to have their store online to generate sales.
Description
What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?
Our purpose is to empower community entrepreneurs to create their envisioned business without the cost of purchasing a physical location. We provide a customized ui to our client’s desire without having them worry about choosing from an endless list of templates or having to learn front end development. In addition, we want to display user analytics to our clients to allow them to make informed decisions on customer’s supply trends. As a stretch feature, we would like to provide recommendation and customization on the customer side as well. \

##Expected Features List

Components

Landing page
Cart

##Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

Our app is most similar to shopify, in terms of ui. We allow our client to display a custom layout that is not available in shopify. We want to enable our client to have creative freedom beyond a template. 
In terms of functionality, we want to take inspiration from ebay, amazon and shopify to create a customer analytics dashboard. What makes our product different from the mentioned companies is the freedom our client has with their data. We are still contemplating whether we would hand off the client’s database or not, depending on the client’s access to a database themselves.
