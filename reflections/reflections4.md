- Name at least one successful thing this week.
  -  Being able to identify key bugs and ensuring that they work. Being able to wrap up cart functionality was key to create a better user experience. 
  
- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?
  - Continuing to work on the front page custom css was challenging. We hope to wrap up any custom looks by next week. Adding addition logic to ensure that errors didn't slow our app was tedious but incredibly rewarding.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)
  - We were able to finish everything we had planned and were able to end last minute features that our mentors adviced us to add.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?
  -  Looking into the material ui documentation was super helpful whenever we were trying to make our UI look cleaner. 

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
  -   Nothing that wasn't moved to a stretched feature is at risk. We might be able to add additional functionality that we originally didn't think we'd have time for.
