- Name at least one successful thing this week.
  - Getting the home page started with custom features and styling with css has been a big win. Successfully inplementing an edit function within the cart was a huge accomplishment. 
  
- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?
  - Having to manage states in order to create the edit function within the cart. In terms of the home page, it was difficult to get components to overlap each other. 

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)
  - We were able to finish all our goals for this week since we revised our original sprint plan due to unseen obstacles last week. Based off the progress we made this week we have a better view into what tasks can feasibly get accomplished next sprint. 

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?
  -  Going through our original sprint plan and discussing it in detail helped us map our efforts in a more efficient way. Previously, we didn't have a gauge of how long certain tasks would take. Our mentors are always insightful in providing feedback with planning and asking questions to help us modularize our process more the following week.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
  -  After re-evaluating and shifting certain features to a stretch category, we are no longer at risk of missing any core user stories. At this point in the capstone we are prioritizing a cleaner user interface and user experience. Once we are satisfied with the design we will discuss which stretch to take on.
